Here’s a detailed step-by-step approach to building QueueClue, your AI-powered DSA guidance assistant. This plan takes you from ideation to a functional MVP and beyond.

🔧 Project Summary

QueueClue will help users solve LeetCode DSA problems by analyzing questions and their solutions (code or approach) and offering non-spoiler hints, guidance, and validation. It acts like a mentor—not a solution bot.

🗺️ Step-by-Step Roadmap

⸻

✅ Phase 1: Project Setup and Planning

🔹 1.1 Define Your Scope (MVP)
	•	Input: LeetCode problem (URL or text) + user’s solution/code
	•	Output: Hints, guidance, and whether the user is on the right track
	•	No direct solutions

🔹 1.2 Tools & Stack

Component	Tech
Frontend	React / Vue / Vite (or Gradio for fast prototype)
Backend	Python + FastAPI / Flask
AI Engine	OpenAI (GPT-3.5/4) or HuggingFace models
Optional Storage	Supabase / Firebase (Free)
Auth (Optional)	Auth0 / Firebase


⸻

⚙️ Phase 2: Core Functionality

🔹 2.1 Parse LeetCode Questions
	•	Paste question or fetch it from a URL (via web scraper if needed)
	•	Extract:
	•	Problem description
	•	Inputs/outputs
	•	Constraints
	•	Examples

🔧 Tools:
	•	BeautifulSoup (for scraping)
	•	LeetCode unofficial API (or static dataset as fallback)

🔹 2.2 Accept User Inputs
	•	Text editor / code input for:
	•	Code snippet
	•	Natural language explanation of approach
	•	Optional: Dropdown for language (Python, Java, etc.)

🔹 2.3 Prompt Engineering
	•	Craft prompts that:
	•	Tell AI to avoid giving exact solutions
	•	Encourage it to give hints, ask questions, and suggest patterns
	•	Use system prompt like:
“You are a DSA mentor. Given a problem and a student’s attempt or idea, provide non-spoiler hints to help them solve it on their own. Never reveal the full code or direct solution.”

⸻

🤖 Phase 3: AI Response Engine

🔹 3.1 OpenAI or Local LLM
	•	Use GPT-3.5 (free-tier via OpenAI Playground or API)
	•	Optional: Use HuggingFace Transformers to run local models (e.g., Mistral, Phi-2) if you’re avoiding cost

🔹 3.2 AI Processing Pipeline
	1.	Receive LeetCode question + user input
	2.	Generate AI prompt dynamically
	3.	Get model’s response (hint, suggestion, or validation)
	4.	Return response to frontend

⸻

🧪 Phase 4: Frontend MVP

🔹 4.1 Minimal UI
	•	Input field: Paste LeetCode problem
	•	Code editor: User inputs code
	•	Button: “Get Clue”
	•	Display:
	•	AI feedback
	•	Visual cues (✅ You’re on the right path / ⚠️ Edge case missed)

🔹 4.2 Optional Enhancements
	•	Syntax highlighting with Monaco Editor
	•	Confidence meter: “Model thinks you’re 80% there”
	•	Step-by-step hint reveal

⸻

🔁 Phase 5: Iteration & UX Improvements

🔹 5.1 Feedback Loop
	•	Let users rate hint helpfulness
	•	Let users request stronger/weaker hints

🔹 5.2 Track Learning Progress (Optional)
	•	Tag problems by DSA topic (arrays, trees, recursion)
	•	Visual progress chart (e.g., radar chart of strength in topics)

⸻

🚀 Phase 6: Hosting & Deployment

🔹 6.1 Hosting Options (Free)
	•	Frontend: Vercel / Netlify
	•	Backend: Render / Railway
	•	Model API: OpenAI (or Hugging Face free inference)

🔹 6.2 Version 1 Launch
	•	Add to GitHub with README, usage instructions
	•	Share with friends or coding community (e.g., Reddit, Discord)

⸻

📌 Extra Features (Post-MVP)
	•	Chat-based mentor UI
	•	Speech-to-hint (voice input)
	•	LeetCode login integration (to auto-fetch problems)
	•	“Hint Level” toggle (mild ↔️ strong hints)
	•	Save session history
	•	Gamify: “Solve with 3 hints or fewer!”

💡 Tips
	•	Focus MVP on 1-2 DSA categories first (e.g., Arrays + Hashmaps)
	•	Test AI behavior with several prompts to ensure it doesn’t solve, only guides
	•	Document examples: “Here’s what a user tried and what QueueClue suggested”
